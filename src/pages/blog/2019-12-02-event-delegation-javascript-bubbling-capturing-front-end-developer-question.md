title: Event Delegation JavaScript Bubbling Capturing Front End Developer Question

description: >-
  Using event delegation allows the developer to write less code to get the same
  result. This is explained very well in the MakingDevelopers YouTube video
  linked below. I’ll attempt to do it justice with text here. There are two
  types of event delegation; bubbling and capturing. Using bubbling the
  developer can send a signal from the child element to the parent element. The
  signal flows upstream, bubbling up. Using capturing the developer can send a
  signal from the parent element to the child element. The signal flows down
  stream.
