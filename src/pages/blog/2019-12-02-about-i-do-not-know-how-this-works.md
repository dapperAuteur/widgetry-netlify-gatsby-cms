i Do NOT Know How `this` Works.

I say that to say this:

I’m using this tool to assist me in learning. I have some experience in some stuff. I have degrees in some things. Do not quote me as an expert. You may disagree and I hope you share your opinion in the comments. [You can learn from a baby if you pay attention](https://genius.com/E-40-tell-it-like-it-is-lyrics). Your comment(s) may get my attention. They may not.

Onward.

Don’t Be Good. Be Great. Be Grateful.
