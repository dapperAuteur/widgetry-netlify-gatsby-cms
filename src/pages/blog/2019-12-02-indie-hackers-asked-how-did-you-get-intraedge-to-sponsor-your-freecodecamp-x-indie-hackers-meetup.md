How did I do it?
Go get your pen and paper. You'll wanna write this down.
...





I asked them if I could use their office to host Meetups.
That's it. It was that easy. I'm a product of the freeCodeCamp community and wanted to get more involved. I wanted to help others in an entrepreneurial way. I wanted to help others learn to code and show them how they may earn money while learning to code. That's what I mean by 'an entrepreneurial way'.

I'll talk more about how I do this and help others do this in future posts.
