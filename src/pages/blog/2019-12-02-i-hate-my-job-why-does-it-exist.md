# I Hate My Job. Why Does It Exist

Fuck Everything And Reload.

I’m afraid that if I fail at my job that another generation will be exploited and repeat mistakes of previous generations. I look out at the crowd and know that they don’t understand what I’m saying. They don’t grasp how important it is to learn this anywhere but through the school of hard knocks. To the audience, it’s just a game.

Most of the time I feel like I’m wasting my time. I look out at the students and I see a multitude of bewildered faces, false positives of following along, etc. And then I’ll ask a question and low and behold I get raised hands and a few correct answers. Those moments bring me back. Those moments are the moments that lead me to believe it’s worth while. I hate my job. Why does it exist. I teach financial literacy to students in the 3rd through 5th grades. I’m not a trained teacher and the teachers I speak to tell me they wish they could teach the program. I ask why they don’t and many say they don’t know where to begin or feel they aren’t qualified to do so. I’ve always understood that if I know more than you I can teach you that more that you don’t know and then you can do the same for the next person. I guess the science of pedagogy doesn’t teach that. Are certificates necessary to teach? If you feel it’s important to teach, don’t let fear stop you from teaching it.

Creating a good foundation and/or helping a student develop an interest is more than enough when it comes to learning about money. The information is out there. Once the student knows that teach them how to search for more and then take the training wheels off. The rest is just practice and execution, developing good habits, hard work and progress.

The mission statement of The United States of Value:

It starts with we.

In hard work we trust and respect.

In progress we trust and respect.
