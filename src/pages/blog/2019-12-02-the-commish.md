# The Commish: The First Pro Kickballer

I’m about to tell you the story about the first professional kickballer. 

What this isn’t: a rags to riches tale nor a tale of super athletic exploits. This is a tale about how a regular person that convinced adults to pay him to chase a big red ball and then throw at them for one hour a week. Thirty weeks a year.

At one time this regular person was the fastest kid in fourth grade. Though you wouldn’t know that by talking to him. Everyone I spoke to always mentioned how humble and professional he was. Just a regular person with adequate aim. Tho’ that alone won’t make one a successful kickball player, let alone a professional.
The Commish. The Commish is what they called him.

 — 

It was a rare rainy night when I arrived at The Compadre Boys & Girls Club in Chandler, Arizona in April 2012. The Commish was walking the bases and placing them in left field. Then I watched as he set-up another kickball diamond in right field. This wasn’t my first kickball game.

It’s a tale of a person that went from being the fastest kid in fourth grade to be the first human being to make a living playing kickball.

It all started in 2009 when a high school friend told me her little sister worked for [WAKA Kickball](http://www.kickball.com). The first thing that came to mind was, “She has to hire me to run a league”.
I was hired in December of ’09 to open [AZ Thunder](http://www.kickball.com/azthunder), the Chandler, AZ kickball league. WAKA had been working, unsuccessfully, to get open for some time and I knew I could get it poppin’. And I did. I played a season in [AZ Fiesta](http://www.kickball.com/azthunder) Spring 2010 Season, the Ahwatukee League. That season I played with Bret Godsey and the Kickball Rookies. It was awesome. Pulled my hamstring and both groins early in the season. They never healed and won the championship in extra innings because no one noticed me limping across home plate to score the winning run.
That summer we got AZ Thunder up and running with 13 teams.
